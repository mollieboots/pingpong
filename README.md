PingPong

by Mollie Bootsma

This program will take user input (a number), turn it and all the numbers that come before it from 1-input and list them in an array, then test them for divisibility. Finally it will display the output as an unordered list with numbers dvisible by 3, 5, and 3&5 displayedd as strings. The specs all pass and there is a seperate file for those tests.
